### What I learned

It's been a long time from the last challenge, I have been learning new stuff and I tryed to apllyed all of that in this new challenge.
I continue working to get better with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and this time I used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage the app's state, I used Git and Github from the beginig to the end, also I have been explored the [Styled Component Library](https://styled-components.com/)(I really liked it).
My next move is it learn more about testing, like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/). See you the next time.

### Continued development

Next I want to explore more about:

- Jest
- Testing Library
- Nextjs.
